# Models
Coding models such as KNN, MLP and Naive Bayes from scratch. 

In this project, I coded the ML models: KNN, MLP and Naive Bayes without importing libraries such as Scikit-Learn. Furthermore, I will delve into the intricate domain of healthcare analytics, specifically focusing on candidemia patients. The dataset comprises 77 features and a binary class label "Outcome" (1 or 0), posing a binary class concept learning challenge. 

My objective is to predict patient outcomes, employing a structured approach encompassing Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, and the evaluation of the three classifiersâ€”K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Naive Bayes, using K-fold cross-validation and the metrics involving Accuracy, F1, Recall, Precision, mcc, auc.
